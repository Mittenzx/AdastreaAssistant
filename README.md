# AdastraAssistant

A voice assistant for game integration, inspired by successful implementations in games like Warframe, Destiny, and Halo.

## Documentation

- **[Voice Assistant Research](VOICE_ASSISTANT_RESEARCH.md)**: Comprehensive research on game voice assistants, including Warframe's Cephalon system, voice synthesis technologies, and implementation patterns
- **[Implementation Roadmap](docs/IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md)**: Phased development plan with technology recommendations and success metrics

## Research Highlights

This project is informed by research into industry-leading voice assistants:

### Key Inspirations

- **Warframe's Cephalon System**: Multiple mode-specific AI companions (Ordis, Cy, Simaris) each with distinct personalities
- **Destiny's Ghost**: Unobtrusive, informative companion that enhances exploration
- **Halo's Cortana**: Emotionally engaging AI with deep narrative integration

### Technology Foundation

- **Voice Synthesis**: Neural network-based TTS with voice cloning capabilities
- **Architecture**: Modular design with NLU, dialogue management, NLG, and TTS components
- **Context Awareness**: Game state integration for relevant, timely responses
- **Memory Systems**: Short-term and long-term memory for consistent personality

## Getting Started

See the [Implementation Roadmap](docs/IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md) for development phases and next steps.

## Project Status

Currently in research and planning phase. Implementation will follow the phased approach outlined in the roadmap documentation.
